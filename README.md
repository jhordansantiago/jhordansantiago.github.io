# Personal Academic Website 

This is your personal academic website with a clean, minimalist design. You are free to use it, just cite me. :)

## Files Included

- `index.html` - About Me page (main page)
- `research.html` - Research interests page
- `publications.html` - Publications and presentations page
- `quotations.html` - Favorite quotations page
- `style.css` - Stylesheet with black and blue theme
- `profile.jpg` - Placeholder for your profile photo
- `placeholder.jpg` - Placeholder for content image
- `cv.pdf` - (You need to add your CV PDF file)

## How to Add Your Content

### 1. Replace Profile Photo
- Replace `profile.jpg` with your actual profile photo
- Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger (square)
- The CSS will automatically make it circular

### 2. Replace Content Image
- Replace `placeholder.jpg` on the About Me page with an actual image
- This could be a research-related image, lab photo, or any relevant visual

### 3. Add Your CV
- Add your CV as `cv.pdf` in the same directory
- The navigation link will automatically point to it

### 4. Update Social Media Links
- In each HTML file, find the social icons section
- Replace the `#` in `href="#"` with your actual profile URLs:
  - ORCID
  - ResearchGate
  - Google Scholar
  - GitHub
  - LinkedIn
  - Lattes (already linked)

### 5. Customize Content
- Edit the text in each HTML file to replace Lorem Ipsum with your actual content
- The structure is already set up - just replace the paragraph text
